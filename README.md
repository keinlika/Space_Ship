# Overview

{This project aims to recreate the classic Asteroids game from 1979, using modern programming techniques. 
The goal is to develop a functional game while applying advanced principles such as object-oriented programming, 
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. By implementing various game elements like the ship, bullets, and asteroids, 
this project enhances skills in real-time game development, physics simulations, and collision detection.}

{The game was developed using the C++ programming language and the OpenGL graphics library. 
I utilized an existing game development framework that provides UI and rendering functions, 
and integrated previous code developed}

{The purpose of building this game is to deepen understanding of game mechanics and improve my ability to 
design software with clean architecture. In particular, this project involves refining skills in handling 
multiple moving objects, user interaction, and creating a fluid, interactive experience. It also offers an opportunity
 to expand knowledge of OpenGL for 2D game rendering.}

# Development Environment

{The project was written and compiled in a Linux environment using standard development tools like g++ for compilation and make for build automation.}

{The project uses C++ as the language, and custom libraries such as uiDraw and uiInteract for handling input and rendering.}
